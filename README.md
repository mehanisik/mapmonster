# MapMonster (The Singularity)

Just a fun side project I put together over the weekend to mess around with **OpenLayers** and **Zustand**.

The idea was to see how well they handle real-time state updates on an interactive world map. It's basically a strategy sim built with Next.js 16 and a bunch of other tools I wanted to try out.

### What's inside

- **Mapping**: OpenLayers (with some dark mode tiles)
- **State**: Zustand + Immer
- **Styles**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Runtime**: Bun

### How to run it

If you want to play around with it:

1. `bun install`
2. `bun run dev`

That's it.
